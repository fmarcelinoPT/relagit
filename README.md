## Roadmap

Before we hit the first stable release, the following features should be implemented:

-   [x] Support for git submodules.
-   [x] Optimisation of git processes and operations, currently there is noticable CPU strain on startup.
-   [x] Commit graph in information modal.
-   [ ] Use libgit2 for git operations instead of the git CLI. (?)

## Building

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/relagit/relagit relagit

cd relagit

pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm make:{platform}
```

Replace `platform` with one of the [supported platforms](https://github.com/relagit/relagit/blob/main/package.json#L21-L23) (e.g. `make:mac`).

You will find an executable in the `out` folder.
